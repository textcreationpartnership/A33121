         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>Edinburgh</hi> 5. <hi>May</hi> 1648. A SHORT INFORMATION FROM THE COMMISSION OF THE GENERALL ASSEMBLY. <hi>Concerning</hi> The Declaration of the Honourable Court of PARLIAMENT, Lately emitted to the Kingdom.</head>
            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough in the Anſwer of <hi>Aprill</hi> 22. which we received in writing from the Honourable Court of Parliament, we are remitted to their Lordſhips Declaration (now printed and publiſhed) therein to find ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52515:3"/>to our eight deſires, preſented to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment March 22. And although theſe deſires were ſuch as were moſt agreeable to the Word of God, and doe highly concern the ſafety and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Religion; yet, after diligent peruſall of the ſaid Declaration of Parliament, wee can not finde therein any one of theſe our eight deſires ſatisfied.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Wee finde twice in the ſaid Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a paſſage cited out of the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both Kingdomes, 1643. <hi>viz.</hi> That the not takers of the Covenant are declared to be publick enemies to Religion and Country, and to be puniſhed as profeſſed adverſaries and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants: But while this paſſage is preſſed and urged upon the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> againſt the Sectaries, wee cannot ſee that it is applied againſt ſuch Malignants, as have not to this day taken the Covenant. Shall we require of them the obſerving of ſuch a rule, and not yet walk by that rule our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3 As the three breaches of Treaties inſiſted upon in the ſaid Declaration are diſputable, and not without controverſie, ſo the three demands ſent to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> (as they are conceived) are of moſt dangerous conſequence to Religion, ſo farre as wee are able to judge of them, or pry into them: And although wee are reall well-wiſhers to his Majeſties Honour, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52515:3"/>and ſafety in ſuch a way as may not be inconſiſtent with the ſafety and ſecurity of Religion; yet the demand of his Majeſties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with Honour Freedom and Safety to ſome of his houſes in or near <hi>London,</hi> before ſecurity had from him, yea before applications to be made to him by his Parliaments for ſettling Religion according to the Covenant, wee conceive to be not only a poſtponing of Chriſts intereſt to be Kings, but an apparent hazzard of the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Ends of the Covenant; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Army being disbanded (as is alſo demanded) and his Majeſty under no reſtraint, but reſtored with Honour, Freedom and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may gather new ſtrength with the help of the Popiſh Prelaticall and Malignant party for hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the ſetling of Religion and Peace according to the Covenant; which wee have the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear and apprehend, his Majeſty ſtill retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his old principles, and having not long ſince profeſſed and declared, that hee is obliged in conſcience to improve that power which God ſhall put in hands for the eſtabliſhing of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy.</p>
            <p n="4">4 There are in the ſaid Declaration divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars highly concerning Religion, determined and reſolved upon, without the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Generall Aſſembly or their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners; which is a great prejudice to the juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and liberties of the Kirk.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52515:4"/>
            <p n="5">5 We doe not finde in the ſaid Declaration all lawfull and poſſible wayes of Peace, and namely by Treaties (as before, in 1639, and 1640.) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured or ſought after, before an ingagement in warre; which method wee conceive to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as well by common and naturall equity, as by the Word of God, and eſpecially between two Kingdoms united by Solemn Covenant.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The Declaration holds forth no reſolution of Parliament for oppoſing and ſuppreſſing of the Popiſh, Prelaticall or Malignant party if they riſe again in armes, but only againſt aſſociating or joyning forces with them, and not ſo much as that, except with limitations in caſe they be refuſers to ſwear and ſubſcribe the Covenant; and in caſe they riſe in armes to oppoſe or obſtruct all, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of the ends of the Covenant. Whereas it may be eaſily foreſeen, that if the Popiſh, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall or Malignant party riſe again in armes in <hi>England,</hi> they cannot only conceale their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the ends of the Covenant, but alſo be eaſily exempted from being reckoned refuſers of the Covenant, the Covenant not being now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon them; and being once ſuffered to riſe in armes (as ſome are already) may grow ſo ſtrong as that it will be very hard and difficult to ſuppreſs them.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Whereas wee have inſiſted for ſatisfaction to our conſciences concerning the perſons to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the managing of the warre, and that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52515:4"/>none may be employed in Comittees and armies but ſuch as have given conſtant proof of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and faithfulneſſe, and againſt whom there is no juſt cauſe of jealouſie; that ſo wee may the more confidently encourage our flocks to follow the cauſe of God in their hands: the Declaration in ſtead of ſatisfying this deſire, doth avoyd and keep off from theſe qualifications deſired by us, and ſo leaves a latitude for employing ſuch as theſe qualifications do not agree to.</p>
            <p>Finally, as we neither were, nor are againſt an engagement, if once ſatisfied in the grounds of undertaking and manner of proceeding, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars expreſſed in our former papers; So for the reaſons before mentioned, and divers others fully expreſſed in our Repreſentation upon the Declaration, wee judge the preſent engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as it is ſtated, unlawfull; and truſt, that all the well affected in the Kingdom will make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their Solemn Vowes, and will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by the grace and aſſiſtance of God to keep themſelves from being enſnared and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longſt in any courſe contrary to the Covenant.</p>
